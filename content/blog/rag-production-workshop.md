I'm excited to announce my new workshop: **Introduction to RAG in Production** - a comprehensive hands-on session designed for teams looking to implement robust RAG systems in real-world environments.

## What You'll Learn

### Foundation & Architecture
- **Introduction to GenAI and LLMs** - Understanding the landscape and capabilities
- **LLM Application Architectures** - Design patterns for scalable systems
- **Embeddings Overview** - What are embeddings and how they power semantic search
- **Vector Database Comparison** - Choosing the right storage solution
- **Data Exploration Fundamentals** - Analyzing and understanding your data for RAG

### Production RAG Pipeline
We'll build a complete RAG system covering every critical step:

1. **Document Preprocessing** - Text extraction, chunking strategies, and optimization
2. **Data Ingestion** - Efficient embedding generation and storage
3. **Querying & Search** - Semantic retrieval and relevance scoring
4. **Document Post-processing** - Context ranking and filtering
5. **Answer Generation** - Prompt engineering and response optimization
6. **Evaluation** - Metrics, testing frameworks, and quality assurance
7. **Production Challenges** - Scaling, monitoring, and maintenance

## Who Should Attend

This workshop is ideal for:
- Engineering teams implementing RAG systems
- Data scientists exploring production deployment
- Product managers overseeing AI initiatives
- CTOs evaluating RAG solutions

## Format

Interactive 3-hour workshop combining theory with practical implementation.
