I'm pleased to share that I've published a comprehensive introduction to vector search on the [Big Data Boutique blog](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/opensearch-and-elasticsearch-vector-search-an-introduction-6af584), exploring how this powerful search technology works in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch.

## What the Article Covers

The article, titled **"OpenSearch and Elasticsearch Vector Search: An Introduction"**, provides a foundational understanding of vector search technology and its implementation in modern search engines.

The piece explores the evolution from traditional keyword-based search to semantic search powered by dense vector embeddings. I break down complex concepts into digestible explanations, covering:

- **The fundamentals of vector search** and how it differs from keyword search
- **Keyword search under the hood** - understanding BM25 and Bag of Words representation
- **Embeddings and dense vectors** - how AI models transform text into meaningful numerical representations
- **k-NN vs ANN algorithms** - the trade-offs between accuracy and performance
- **Practical use cases** including semantic search, recommendation engines, and multimedia search

## Bridging Theory and Practice

As someone who's spent years working with Elasticsearch and now focuses on GenAI applications, I wanted to create content that bridges the gap between traditional search and modern AI-powered approaches. The article shows how vector search addresses the limitations of keyword search - from handling synonyms to capturing semantic context.

## Why This Foundation Matters

Understanding vector search fundamentals is crucial for anyone working with modern search applications. Whether you're building recommendation systems, implementing semantic search, or working with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, these concepts form the backbone of how search engines can understand meaning rather than just matching keywords.
