I'm excited to announce that I'll be delivering a comprehensive workshop on **July 30th, 2025** titled "[RAG with OpenSearch: A Crash Course for Building RAG Applications](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7350900293720584194/)" hosted by Big Data Boutique.

## What You'll Learn

This hands-on workshop is designed to take you from concept to implementation, covering the complete RAG pipeline with OpenSearch. Whether you're working on proof-of-concept projects or looking to build production-ready solutions, this session will provide practical insights you can apply immediately.

### Complete RAG Pipeline Coverage

We'll walk through every step of building a robust RAG system:

**üîß Data Preparation**
- Structuring documents for optimal chunking
- Metadata enrichment strategies
- Efficient indexing approaches

**üß† Embeddings & Vector Storage**
- Choosing the right embedding model for your use case
- Generating semantic vectors at scale
- Storing and retrieving vectors efficiently in OpenSearch with k-NN and HNSW

**üîç Hybrid Search Implementation**
- Blending keyword-based and semantic retrieval
- Optimizing for better relevance and accuracy
- Real-world search scenarios and solutions

**ü§ñ LLM Integration**
- Passing context effectively to language models
- Pre- and post-processing techniques for better responses
- Generating accurate, grounded answers with LLMs

## Who Should Attend

This workshop is **ideal for**:
- **Developers** building AI-powered applications
- **Data Engineers** working with search and retrieval systems
- **AI Practitioners** looking to move from proof-of-concept to production-ready solutions
- Anyone interested in understanding how modern RAG systems work under the hood

## Why This Matters

Having worked extensively with both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, and now leading GenAI initiatives at Big Data Boutique, I've seen firsthand the challenges teams face when building RAG applications. This workshop addresses the gap between tutorial-level examples and production-ready systems.

You'll learn not just *how* to build RAG applications, but *why* certain design decisions matter, and how to avoid common pitfalls that can derail projects.

## Building on Real Experience

This workshop draws from my experience:
- As a former Elastic team member who worked on search infrastructure
- Leading GenAI projects at Big Data Boutique
- Creating the [OpenSearch vector search tutorials](/blog/opensearch-vector-database-tutorial/) that were [featured on the official OpenSearch blog](/blog/opensearch-blog-feature/)
- Building production RAG systems for various clients

## What You'll Take Away

By the end of this session, you'll have:
- **Clear understanding** of the complete RAG pipeline
- **Practical knowledge** for setting up and optimizing RAG systems with OpenSearch
- **Production insights** for building scalable, reliable solutions
- **Best practices** for data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval
- **Real-world examples** you can adapt to your own projects

## Join the Workshop

üìÖ **Date**: July 30th, 2025
