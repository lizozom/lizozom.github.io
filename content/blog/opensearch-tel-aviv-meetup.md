I had the pleasure of presenting at the very first **OpenSearch Tel Aviv meetup** this past Monday! The event, aptly titled "Search & Generate," brought together the intersection of OpenSearch and Generative AI in a fantastic community gathering.

## The Event: Search Meets Story

This wasn't just another meetup - it was a historic moment as the **first ever OpenSearch meetup in Israel**. The evening was perfectly described as "search meets story, index meets imagination," and it truly lived up to that promise.

## My Talk: WTF Are Embeddings?

I presented **"WTF Are Embeddings?"** - a friendly dive into the mathematical magic behind embeddings. The talk covered:

- **What embeddings actually are** and why they matter
- **Which embeddings to choose** for different use cases  
- **How to generate them** effectively
- **Practical insights** from real-world implementations

The goal was to make embeddings accessible and fun, demystifying the concepts that power modern AI applications.
