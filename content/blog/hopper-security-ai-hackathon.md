Had an incredible day leading an **AI Hackathon** at [Hopper Security](https://www.hopper.security/)! Watching teams tackle GenAI challenges and design creative solutions for their product was energizing.

We started with LLM-powered application patterns that go beyond basic prompting:
- **Advanced RAG Techniques** - Moving past simple retrieval
- **Agents and Agentic AI** - Building autonomous, reasoning systems
- **Playbook-driven agents** - Structured workflows with LLM flexibility
- **Code analysis with AST and Embeddings** - Understanding codebases semantically

These architectural patterns gave teams a foundation to think bigger about what's possible.

But the real highlight was sitting with each team to plan their approach. We worked through problem framing, architecture selection, and feasibility—ensuring ideas were both ambitious and achievable.

Each team brought unique perspectives. The discussions went deep, challenging assumptions and exploring trade-offs between different technical approaches.

I'm excited to see these ideas evolve into real product features that push the boundaries of what's possible with GenAI in security
