I'll be speaking at [Build Stuff](https://www.buildstuff.events/) in Vilnius, Lithuania this December. Looking forward to it!

## Building Advanced RAGs with Elasticsearch / OpenSearch

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is built in three steps: understanding the query, executing a retrieval step, and generating a response. Each step has its own unique characteristics and challenges.

In this session, we'll go through common pitfalls (and solutions!) for each step, and demonstrate how you can build an efficient RAG using Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

### What to expect

We'll cover:
- Query processing and intent understanding
- Effective retrieval strategies
- Response generation techniques
- Real-world examples and practical patterns

The focus is on the practical stuff - the challenges you actually run into when building RAG systems in production, not just the happy path demos.
