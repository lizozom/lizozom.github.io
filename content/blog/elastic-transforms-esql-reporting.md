I'm excited to share that I've published a practical article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lizka.k/create-blazing-fast-reports-with-elastic-transforms-and-es-ql-ef918e7b384f) demonstrating how to solve reporting performance challenges using Elasticsearch Transforms combined with the newly announced ES|QL (Elasticsearch Query Language) from ELK 8.14.

## The Challenge: Slow and Cumbersome Reporting

The article addresses a real-world problem I encountered while working with a client whose reporting system was struggling with performance issues as data volumes increased. Generating reports had become a bottleneck, preventing timely business decisions and creating maintenance headaches for the development team.

## The Solution: Elastic Transforms + ES|QL

I demonstrate how combining these two powerful Elasticsearch features can dramatically improve reporting performance while making queries more intuitive and maintainable.

### Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

The article explores why directly querying large indices with KQL (Kibana Query Language) creates problems:

- **Complex and hard-to-maintain queries**
- **Nested JSON responses** requiring additional server-side processing
- **Performance degradation** as data moves to cold storage or indices grow large

### A Better Approach

Instead, I show how to:

1. **Define transforms** that continuously aggregate data from source indices
2. **Create optimized reporting indices** with pre-calculated metrics
3. **Use ES|QL** to query transformed data with SQL-like syntax

This article represents the practical application of advanced Elasticsearch features to solve real business problems - something I'm passionate about as both a former Elastic team member and current consultant helping organizations optimize their search and analytics infrastructure.
