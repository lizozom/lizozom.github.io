Had a fantastic time delivering an **Advanced RAG Workshop** at [Astrix Security](https://astrix.security/)! This was a deep dive into building production-grade LLM applications with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques.

## What We Covered

The workshop combined theory with hands-on experimentation, focusing on practical techniques teams can implement immediately:

- Understanding embedding models and their trade-offs
- Semantic vs. keyword search: when to use what
- Vector database options and considerations
- Chunking strategies beyond naive splitting
- Hybrid search combining multiple retrieval methods
- Experimenting with AWS Knowledgebase on real datasets

## Thank You!

Big thanks to the Astrix Security team for hosting such an engaged and curious group!
Looking forward to seeing what the team builds with these techniques!
