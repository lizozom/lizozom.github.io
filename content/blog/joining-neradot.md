## About Neradot

Neradot is an AI solutions company that specializes in building custom AI assistants and copilots for businesses. We turn infinite AI possibilities into focused execution—working with clients to understand their specific challenges and creating AI solutions tailored to drive measurable business impact.

Our service encompasses the full development lifecycle: from ideation and discovery through solution design, development, training, integration, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.

## What I'll Be Doing

As CEO, I'll be leading Neradot's vision and strategy as we help businesses harness the power of AI. This role brings together everything I've been passionate about over the past few years—building production-grade RAG systems, working with LLMs, and delivering real value through AI.

After years of consulting and helping companies navigate from "promising POC" to scalable production architecture, I'm thrilled to be taking on this leadership role at a company that shares my pragmatic approach to AI.

## Looking Forward

I'm looking forward to working with the talented team at Neradot and continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI in production environments.
