I'm excited to share my latest tutorial on the [Big Data Boutique blog](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/recipes-to-vectors-using-opensearch-as-vector-database-aba607), where I dive deep into using OpenSearch as a vector database through a practical, hands-on approach with real recipe data.

## What the Tutorial Covers

The article, titled **"Recipes to Vectors: Using OpenSearch as Vector Database"**, takes you through the complete journey of building a vector-powered search application. Using a Kaggle recipe dataset, we explore how to transform text into searchable vectors and implement different search strategies.

The tutorial covers the entire workflow from data to deployment:

- **Dataset selection and preparation** - Working with real recipe data including ingredients, instructions, and metadata
- **Embedding model selection** - Choosing and implementing Cohere's embed-english-v3 model
- **Index configuration** - Setting up OpenSearch with proper k-NN settings and vector field mappings
- **Embedding construction** - Combining multiple fields into meaningful text representations
- **Data ingestion** - Using OpenSearch's Bulk API to index vectors efficiently
- **Search implementation** - Building keyword search, semantic search, and hybrid search queries

## A Practical, Code-First Approach

What makes this tutorial unique is its hands-on nature. Rather than just explaining concepts, we work with actual data and provide complete code examples available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BigDataBoutique/opensearch-semantic-search-tutorial). You'll see how to:

- Transform recipe names, ingredients, and instructions into effective embedding text
- Configure OpenSearch indices with proper k-NN plugin settings
- Handle real-world search scenarios like finding "Asian-inspired chicken recipes with noodles and peanuts"
- Implement hybrid search to combine semantic understanding with structured filtering

## Building on the Foundation

This tutorial represents the second article in our vector search implementation series. It builds on the [foundational concepts](/blog/vector-search-introduction/) we covered earlier while complementing the [Elasticsearch-focused tutorial](/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/) I shared previously.

The beauty of working with recipe data is that it demonstrates both structured (categories, cooking time) and unstructured (instructions, ingredients) data scenarios - making it an excellent example for understanding when to use keyword search versus semantic search.

## Why This Matters for Developers

As someone who's been working extensively with search technologies and now focuses on GenAI applications, I believe that understanding the low-level mechanics of vector databases is crucial. This tutorial gives you the foundation to build more sophisticated applications like recommendation engines, RAG systems, and AI-powered search experiences.
