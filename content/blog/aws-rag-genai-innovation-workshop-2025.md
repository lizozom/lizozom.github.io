As part of my work with BigData Boutique, I'll be teaming up with the AWS team to deliver the **AWS RAG & GenAI Innovation Workshop 2025**.

It's a focused, practical session where we help a customer build a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation demo on *their own* data—not sample docs. The goal: leave with something tangible you can iterate on internally.

## What we actually do
- Understand the user problem and pick a target use case
- Collect and lightly structure a slice of your real content
- Chunk + preprocess (keep it simple, explain trade-offs)
- Generate embeddings and load a vector store
- Wire retrieval + LLM prompt flow
- Add basic guardrails & relevance sanity checks
- Quick evaluation loop (spot checks + simple metrics)
- Leave you with next-step pointers (hardening, scaling, monitoring)

## Who it's for
Teams who want to move from slides / pilots to something concrete, fast.
