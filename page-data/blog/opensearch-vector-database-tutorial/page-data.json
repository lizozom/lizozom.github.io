Using a Kaggle recipe dataset, we explore how to transform text into searchable vectors and implement different search strategies.</p>\n<p>The tutorial covers the entire workflow from data to deployment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dataset selection and preparation</strong> - Working with real recipe data including ingredients, instructions, and metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Embedding model selection</strong> - Choosing and implementing Cohere’s embed-english-v3 model</li>\n<li><strong>Index configuration</strong> - Setting up OpenSearch with proper k-NN settings and vector field mappings</li>\n<li><strong>Embedding construction</strong> - Combining multiple fields into meaningful text representations</li>\n<li><strong>Data ingestion</strong> - Using OpenSearch’s Bulk API to index vectors efficiently</li>\n<li><strong>Search implementation</strong> - Building keyword search, semantic search, and hybrid search queries</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A Practical, Code-First Approach</h2>\n<p>What makes this tutorial unique is its hands-on nature. Rather than just explaining concepts, we work with actual data and provide complete code examples available on <a href=\"https://github.com/BigDataBoutique/opensearch-semantic-search-tutorial\">GitHub</a>. You’ll see how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transform recipe names, ingredients, and instructions into effective embedding text</li>\n<li>Configure OpenSearch indices with proper k-NN plugin settings</li>\n<li>Handle real-world search scenarios like finding “Asian-inspired chicken recipes with noodles and peanuts”</li>\n<li>Implement hybrid search to combine semantic understanding with structured filtering</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building on the Foundation</h2>\n<p>This tutorial represents the second article in our vector search implementation series. It builds on the <a href=\"/blog/vector-search-introduction/\">foundational concepts</a> we covered earlier while complementing the <a href=\"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/\">Elasticsearch-focused tutorial</a> I shared previously.</p>\n<p>The beauty of working with recipe data is that it demonstrates both structured (categories, cooking time) and unstructured (instructions, ingredients) data scenarios - making it an excellent example for understanding when to use keyword search versus semantic search.</p>\n<h2>Why This Matters for Developers</h2>\n<p>As someone who’s been working extensively with search technologies and now focuses on GenAI applications, I believe that understanding the low-level mechanics of vector databases is crucial. This tutorial gives you the foundation to build more sophisticated applications like recommendation engines, RAG systems, and AI-powered search experiences.</p>\n<h2>Read the Complete Tutorial</h2>\n<p>Dive into the full hands-on guide on the Big Data Boutique blog: <a href=\"https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/recipes-to-vectors-using-opensearch-as-vector-database-aba607\">Recipes to Vectors: Using OpenSearch as Vector Database</a></p>\n<p>Whether you’re new to vector search or looking to understand OpenSearch’s specific implementation, this tutorial provides the practical knowledge you need to start building vector-powered applications today.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-vector-database-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Tutorial: Building Vector Search Applications with OpenSearch","date":"April 10, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-04-10","description":"I published a comprehensive hands-on tutorial on the Big Data Boutique blog demonstrating how to use OpenSearch as a vector database with real-world recipe data.","author":"Liza Katz"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-vector-database-tutorial/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Tutorial: Building Semantic Search Applications with Elasticsearch"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/shraga-rag-framework/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Shraga: A Minimal RAG Framework for Production"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877819913"],"slicesMap":{}}
