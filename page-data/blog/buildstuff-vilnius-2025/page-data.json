(aka Lizozom)</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant with over 20 years of experience building large-scale backend systems.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>While the industry chases hype, I focus on the complex intersection of Search Infrastructure (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and Generative AI. I help companies move RAG and vector search from \"promising POC\" to scalable production architecture.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Beyond consulting, I believe in demystifying technology. I created the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" talk, I deliver workshops, lead hackathons and speak frequently at events like PyCon and BuildStuff.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When I'm not debugging pipelines, I'm designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"9b20f872-507a-5194-a397-8f7fb7659c56","excerpt":"I’ll be speaking at Build Stuff in Vilnius, Lithuania this December.

Each step has its own unique characteristics and challenges.</p>\n<p>In this session, we’ll go through common pitfalls (and solutions!) for each step, and demonstrate how you can build an efficient RAG using Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.</p>\n<h3>What to expect</h3>\n<p>We’ll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Query processing and intent understanding</li>\n<li>Effective retrieval strategies</li>\n<li>Response generation techniques</li>\n<li>Real-world examples and practical patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The focus is on the practical stuff - the challenges you actually run into when building RAG systems in production, not just the happy path demos.</p>\n<h2>Details</h2>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> December 3-5, 2025<br>\n<strong>Where:</strong> Vilnius, Lithuania<br>\n<strong>Conference:</strong> Built Stuff</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in attending, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.buildstuff.events/9800492\">15% discount available</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/buildstuff-vilnius-2025/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Speaking at Build Stuff Vilnius 2025","date":"October 27, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-10-27","description":"I'll be speaking at Build Stuff in Vilnius, Lithuania on the 3rd of December 2025.
