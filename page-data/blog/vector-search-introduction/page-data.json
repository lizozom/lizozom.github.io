I break down complex concepts into digestible explanations, covering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The fundamentals of vector search</strong> and how it differs from keyword search</li>\n<li><strong>Keyword search under the hood</strong> - understanding BM25 and Bag of Words representation</li>\n<li><strong>Embeddings and dense vectors</strong> - how AI models transform text into meaningful numerical representations</li>\n<li><strong>k-NN vs ANN algorithms</strong> - the trade-offs between accuracy and performance</li>\n<li><strong>Practical use cases</strong> including semantic search, recommendation engines, and multimedia search</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bridging Theory and Practice</h2>\n<p>As someone who’s spent years working with Elasticsearch and now focuses on GenAI applications, I wanted to create content that bridges the gap between traditional search and modern AI-powered approaches. The article shows how vector search addresses the limitations of keyword search - from handling synonyms to capturing semantic context.</p>\n<h2>Why This Foundation Matters</h2>\n<p>Understanding vector search fundamentals is crucial for anyone working with modern search applications. Whether you’re building recommendation systems, implementing semantic search, or working with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, these concepts form the backbone of how search engines can understand meaning rather than just matching keywords.</p>\n<h2>Read the Full Article</h2>\n<p>Dive into the complete introduction on the Big Data Boutique blog: <a href=\"https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/opensearch-and-elasticsearch-vector-search-an-introduction-6af584\">OpenSearch and Elasticsearch Vector Search: An Introduction</a></p>\n<p>This article sets the foundation for more advanced topics we’ll be covering, including the hands-on tutorial for building semantic search applications that I shared in my <a href=\"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/\">previous post</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/vector-search-introduction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Article: Understanding Vector Search in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch","date":"February 03, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-02-03","description":"I published a foundational article on the Big Data Boutique blog introducing vector search concepts and how they work in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/vector-search-introduction/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/elastic-transforms-esql-reporting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Article: Building Blazing Fast Reports with Elastic Transforms and ES|QL"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Tutorial: Building Semantic Search Applications with Elasticsearch"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3354080379"],"slicesMap":{}}
