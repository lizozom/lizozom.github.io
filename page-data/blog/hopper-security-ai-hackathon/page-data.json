In the industry, I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant specializing in Search Infrastructure and Generative AI.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>With over 20 years of experience, I help companies navigate the complex intersection of traditional search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and modern AI implementation. Currently, I work with BigData Boutique, where I focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and building scalable data architectures.<p>\n<br/>\n<p>I don't just write code; I teach it. I’m the creator of the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" course and a frequent speaker at events like PyCon Israel and OpenSearchCon.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m not debugging an LLM pipeline or researching multimodal embeddings, I’m designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three \"opinionated\" cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>\n<br/><p>\n    <b>Available for GenAI consulting, partnerships, public speaking, and private workshops.</b></p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"88f9a83c-567f-5893-841a-c5dd066b29f1","excerpt":"Had an incredible day leading an AI Hackathon at Hopper Security!

Watching teams tackle GenAI challenges and design creative solutions for their product was energizing.</p>\n<p>We started with LLM-powered application patterns that go beyond basic prompting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced RAG Techniques</strong> - Moving past simple retrieval</li>\n<li><strong>Agents and Agentic AI</strong> - Building autonomous, reasoning systems</li>\n<li><strong>Playbook-driven agents</strong> - Structured workflows with LLM flexibility</li>\n<li><strong>Code analysis with AST and Embeddings</strong> - Understanding codebases semantically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These architectural patterns gave teams a foundation to think bigger about what’s possible.</p>\n<p>But the real highlight was sitting with each team to plan their approach. We worked through problem framing, architecture selection, and feasibility—ensuring ideas were both ambitious and achievable.</p>\n<p>Each team brought unique perspectives. The discussions went deep, challenging assumptions and exploring trade-offs between different technical approaches.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to see these ideas evolve into real product features that push the boundaries of what’s possible with GenAI in security</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Looking to energize your team with a GenAI hackathon or workshop?
