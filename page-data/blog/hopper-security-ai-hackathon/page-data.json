(aka Lizozom)</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant with over 20 years of experience building large-scale backend systems.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>While the industry chases hype, I focus on the complex intersection of Search Infrastructure (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and Generative AI. I help companies move RAG and vector search from \"promising POC\" to scalable production architecture.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Beyond consulting, I believe in demystifying technology. I created the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" talk, I deliver workshops, lead hackathons and speak frequently at events like PyCon and BuildStuff.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When I'm not debugging pipelines, I'm designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"88f9a83c-567f-5893-841a-c5dd066b29f1","excerpt":"Had an incredible day leading an AI Hackathon at Hopper Security!

Watching teams tackle GenAI challenges and design creative solutions for their product was energizing.</p>\n<p>We started with LLM-powered application patterns that go beyond basic prompting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced RAG Techniques</strong> - Moving past simple retrieval</li>\n<li><strong>Agents and Agentic AI</strong> - Building autonomous, reasoning systems</li>\n<li><strong>Playbook-driven agents</strong> - Structured workflows with LLM flexibility</li>\n<li><strong>Code analysis with AST and Embeddings</strong> - Understanding codebases semantically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These architectural patterns gave teams a foundation to think bigger about what’s possible.</p>\n<p>But the real highlight was sitting with each team to plan their approach. We worked through problem framing, architecture selection, and feasibility—ensuring ideas were both ambitious and achievable.</p>\n<p>Each team brought unique perspectives. The discussions went deep, challenging assumptions and exploring trade-offs between different technical approaches.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to see these ideas evolve into real product features that push the boundaries of what’s possible with GenAI in security</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Looking to energize your team with a GenAI hackathon or workshop? I help organizations explore cutting-edge AI techniques and build practical solutions. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/\">Let’s connect on LinkedIn</a> to discuss how we can bring innovation to your team!</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/hopper-security-ai-hackathon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Leading an AI Hackathon at Hopper Security","date":"December 16, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-12-16","description":"Led an AI hackathon at Hopper Security, exploring advanced LLM architectures and helping teams tackle real GenAI product challenges.","author":"Liza Katz"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hopper-security-ai-hackathon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/astrix-security-advanced-rag-workshop/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Advanced RAG Workshop at Astrix Security"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/joining-neradot/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Joining Neradot as CEO"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877819913"],"slicesMap":{}}
