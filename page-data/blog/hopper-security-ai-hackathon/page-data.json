Watching teams tackle GenAI challenges and design creative solutions for their product was energizing.</p>\n<p>We started with LLM-powered application patterns that go beyond basic prompting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced RAG Techniques</strong> - Moving past simple retrieval</li>\n<li><strong>Agents and Agentic AI</strong> - Building autonomous, reasoning systems</li>\n<li><strong>Playbook-driven agents</strong> - Structured workflows with LLM flexibility</li>\n<li><strong>Code analysis with AST and Embeddings</strong> - Understanding codebases semantically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These architectural patterns gave teams a foundation to think bigger about what’s possible.</p>\n<p>But the real highlight was sitting with each team to plan their approach. We worked through problem framing, architecture selection, and feasibility—ensuring ideas were both ambitious and achievable.</p>\n<p>Each team brought unique perspectives. The discussions went deep, challenging assumptions and exploring trade-offs between different technical approaches.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to see these ideas evolve into real product features that push the boundaries of what’s possible with GenAI in security</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Looking to energize your team with a GenAI hackathon or workshop?
