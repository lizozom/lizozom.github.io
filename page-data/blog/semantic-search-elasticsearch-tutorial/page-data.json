We work directly with Elasticsearch’s low-level APIs to handle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vector mapping and configuration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Embedding generation and indexing</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid search query construction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Performance optimization techniques</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why This Matters</h2>\n<p>As someone who’s been working extensively with search technologies and now specializing in GenAI applications, I believe that understanding how to properly implement semantic search is crucial for modern applications. The combination of traditional keyword search with semantic understanding creates powerful search experiences that can better understand user intent.</p>\n<h2>A Hands-On Approach</h2>\n<p>Rather than just covering theory, this tutorial takes you through building a real application. You’ll learn how to leverage Elasticsearch as a vector database while gaining a deeper understanding of how vector-powered applications work under the hood.</p>\n<h2>Read the Full Tutorial</h2>\n<p>Check out the complete tutorial on the Big Data Boutique blog: <a href=\"https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/semantic-search-application-with-elasticsearch-vector-database-ceed7f\">Semantic Search Application with Elasticsearch Vector Database</a></p>\n<p>Whether you’re new to vector search or looking to deepen your understanding of Elasticsearch’s vector capabilities, this tutorial provides practical insights you can apply to your own projects.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Tutorial: Building Semantic Search Applications with Elasticsearch","date":"March 04, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-03-04","description":"I published a comprehensive hands-on tutorial on the Big Data Boutique blog about building hybrid search applications using Elasticsearch as a vector database.","author":"Liza Katz"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/semantic-search-elasticsearch-tutorial/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/vector-search-introduction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Article: Understanding Vector Search in OpenSearch and Elasticsearch"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-vector-database-tutorial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Tutorial: Building Vector Search Applications with OpenSearch"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877819913"],"slicesMap":{}}
