In the industry, I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant specializing in Search Infrastructure and Generative AI.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>With over 20 years of experience, I help companies navigate the complex intersection of traditional search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and modern AI implementation. Currently, I work with BigData Boutique, where I focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and building scalable data architectures.<p>\n<br/>\n<p>I don't just write code; I teach it. I’m the creator of the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" course and a frequent speaker at events like PyCon Israel and OpenSearchCon.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m not debugging an LLM pipeline or researching multimodal embeddings, I’m designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three \"opinionated\" cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>\n<br/><p>\n    <b>Available for GenAI consulting, partnerships, public speaking, and private workshops.</b></p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"35c414e9-ce3e-5781-b965-f7023ced7ca9","excerpt":"I had the pleasure of presenting at the very first OpenSearch Tel Aviv meetup hosted by Big Data Boutique this past Monday!

The event, aptly titled “Search &#x26; Generate,” brought together the intersection of OpenSearch and Generative AI in a fantastic community gathering.</p>\n<h2>The Event: Search Meets Story</h2>\n<p>This wasn’t just another meetup - it was a historic moment as the <strong>first ever OpenSearch meetup in Israel</strong>. The evening was perfectly described as “search meets story, index meets imagination,” and it truly lived up to that promise.</p>\n<h2>My Talk: WTF Are Embeddings?</h2>\n<p>I presented <strong>“WTF Are Embeddings?”</strong> - a friendly dive into the mathematical magic behind embeddings. The talk covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What embeddings actually are</strong> and why they matter</li>\n<li><strong>Which embeddings to choose</strong> for different use cases</li>\n<li><strong>How to generate them</strong> effectively</li>\n<li><strong>Practical insights</strong> from real-world implementations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal was to make embeddings accessible and fun, demystifying the concepts that power modern AI applications.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-tel-aviv-meetup/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Presented at the First OpenSearch Tel Aviv Meetup: WTF Are Embeddings?","date":"May 05, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-05-05","description":"I had the pleasure of presenting at the inaugural OpenSearch Tel Aviv meetup, sharing insights about embeddings in a fun and educational talk.","author":"Liza Katz"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-tel-aviv-meetup/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/shraga-rag-framework/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Shraga: A Minimal RAG Framework for Production"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/opensearch-blog-feature/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Featured on the Official OpenSearch Blog: Recipes to Vectors Tutorial"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877819913"],"slicesMap":{}}
