My talk, titled <strong>“WTF Are Embeddings? A software engineer’s take”</strong>, is scheduled for September 9th at 15:30 in Hall 7.</p>\n<h2>The Talk: WTF Are Embeddings?</h2>\n<p>Embeddings are everywhere in modern AI - powering search engines, recommendation systems, and those surprisingly accurate chatbots we interact with daily. But for many software engineers, they remain a mysterious black box wrapped in academic jargon and complex mathematics.</p>\n<p>That’s exactly what my talk aims to fix.</p>\n<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>\n<p><strong>“WTF Are Embeddings?”</strong> is designed specifically for developers who want to understand embeddings without needing a data science PhD. Here’s what we’ll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What embeddings actually are</strong> - in plain English, not mathematical formulas</li>\n<li><strong>Real-world examples</strong> showing how words, products, and even bananas become vectors in high-dimensional space</li>\n<li><strong>Practical Python implementations</strong> using everyday tools you already know</li>\n<li><strong>When and why to use embeddings</strong> in your own projects</li>\n<li><strong>Common pitfalls and how to avoid them</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>See You There!</h2>\n<p>If you’re attending PyCon Israel 2025, please come to Hall 7 on September 9th at 15:30. Bring your questions, your curiosity, and your willingness to finally understand what all the embedding fuss is about!</p>\n<p>Can’t make it to the conference? Don’t worry - I’ll be sharing key insights and examples from the talk right here on my blog after the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Conference Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Event</strong>: PyCon Israel 2025</li>\n<li><strong>Talk</strong>: “WTF Are Embeddings?
