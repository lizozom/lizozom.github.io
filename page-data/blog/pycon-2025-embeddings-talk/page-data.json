My talk, titled <strong>“WTF Are Embeddings? A software engineer’s take”</strong>, is scheduled for September 9th at 15:30 in Hall 7.</p>\n<h2>The Talk: WTF Are Embeddings?</h2>\n<p>Embeddings are everywhere in modern AI - powering search engines, recommendation systems, and those surprisingly accurate chatbots we interact with daily. But for many software engineers, they remain a mysterious black box wrapped in academic jargon and complex mathematics.</p>\n<p>That’s exactly what my talk aims to fix.</p>\n<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>\n<p><strong>“WTF Are Embeddings?”</strong> is designed specifically for developers who want to understand embeddings without needing a data science PhD. Here’s what we’ll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What embeddings actually are</strong> - in plain English, not mathematical formulas</li>\n<li><strong>Real-world examples</strong> showing how words, products, and even bananas become vectors in high-dimensional space</li>\n<li><strong>Practical Python implementations</strong> using everyday tools you already know</li>\n<li><strong>When and why to use embeddings</strong> in your own projects</li>\n<li><strong>Common pitfalls and how to avoid them</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Software Engineer’s Perspective</h3>\n<p>As someone with 20+ years of experience writing code and leading teams, I bring a distinctly practical perspective to this topic. I’m not a data science PhD - I’m a regular software engineer who’s learned to build clever AI tools using Python, search technologies, and large language models.</p>\n<h2>Why This Talk Matters</h2>\n<p>The AI revolution is happening now, and embeddings are at its core. Yet too many excellent developers feel left out because the existing explanations are either too academic or too simplified. My goal is to bridge that gap with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real examples</strong> you can relate to</li>\n<li><strong>Bad charts</strong> that actually help explain complex concepts</li>\n<li><strong>Humor</strong> to make the learning process enjoyable</li>\n<li><strong>Practical takeaways</strong> you can use immediately</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>See You There!</h2>\n<p>If you’re attending PyCon Israel 2025, please come to Hall 7 on September 9th at 15:30. Bring your questions, your curiosity, and your willingness to finally understand what all the embedding fuss is about!</p>\n<p>Can’t make it to the conference? Don’t worry - I’ll be sharing key insights and examples from the talk right here on my blog after the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Conference Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Event</strong>: PyCon Israel 2025</li>\n<li><strong>Talk</strong>: “WTF Are Embeddings?
