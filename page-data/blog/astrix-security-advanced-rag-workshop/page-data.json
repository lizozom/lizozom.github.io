(aka Lizozom)</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant with over 20 years of experience building large-scale backend systems.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>While the industry chases hype, I focus on the complex intersection of Search Infrastructure (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and Generative AI. I help companies move RAG and vector search from \"promising POC\" to scalable production architecture.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Beyond consulting, I believe in demystifying technology. I created the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" talk, I deliver workshops, lead hackathons and speak frequently at events like PyCon and BuildStuff.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When I'm not debugging pipelines, I'm designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"79ca6a5f-5a1c-50f9-ae7e-c56f56083edf","excerpt":"This workshop was delivered as part of my work with Big Data Boutique.

This was a deep dive into building production-grade LLM applications with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques.</p>\n<h2>What We Covered</h2>\n<p>The workshop combined theory with hands-on experimentation, focusing on practical techniques teams can implement immediately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding embedding models and their trade-offs</li>\n<li>Semantic vs. keyword search: when to use what</li>\n<li>Vector database options and considerations</li>\n<li>Chunking strategies beyond naive splitting</li>\n<li>Hybrid search combining multiple retrieval methods</li>\n<li>Experimenting with AWS Knowledgebase on real datasets</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thank You!</h2>\n<p>Big thanks to the Astrix Security team for hosting such an engaged and curious group!\nLooking forward to seeing what the team builds with these techniques!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGD1RuEz7FzUA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZrWRFNqIoA0-/0/1764531394735?e=1767830400&#x26;v=beta&#x26;t=A9DHQGDVnMBi4yI7rhCA6pAqaYwMvYd-aEKI0XLViuI\" alt=\"Workshop at Astrix\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Interested in hosting a similar workshop for your team?
