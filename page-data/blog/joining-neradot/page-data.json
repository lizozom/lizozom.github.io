(aka Lizozom)</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant with over 20 years of experience building large-scale backend systems.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>While the industry chases hype, I focus on the complex intersection of Search Infrastructure (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and Generative AI. I help companies move RAG and vector search from \"promising POC\" to scalable production architecture.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Beyond consulting, I believe in demystifying technology. I created the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" talk, I deliver workshops, lead hackathons and speak frequently at events like PyCon and BuildStuff.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When I'm not debugging pipelines, I'm designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"6d540944-37cd-5d8f-81b8-f37dd057b2df","excerpt":"I’m excited to share that I’m joining Neradot as CEO!
