In the industry, I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant specializing in Search Infrastructure and Generative AI.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>With over 20 years of experience, I help companies navigate the complex intersection of traditional search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and modern AI implementation. Currently, I work with BigData Boutique, where I focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and building scalable data architectures.<p>\n<br/>\n<p>I don't just write code; I teach it. I’m the creator of the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" course and a frequent speaker at events like PyCon Israel and OpenSearchCon.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m not debugging an LLM pipeline or researching multimodal embeddings, I’m designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three \"opinionated\" cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>\n<br/><p>\n    <b>Available for GenAI consulting, partnerships, public speaking, and private workshops.</b></p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"fd0b9217-2b86-5191-a364-7a2719755ff6","excerpt":"I’m excited to share that I’ve earned the AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification!
