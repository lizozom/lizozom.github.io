In the industry, I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Consultant specializing in Search Infrastructure and Generative AI.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>With over 20 years of experience, I help companies navigate the complex intersection of traditional search (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) and modern AI implementation. Currently, I work with BigData Boutique, where I focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings, and building scalable data architectures.<p>\n<br/>\n<p>I don't just write code; I teach it. I’m the creator of the \"WTF Are Embeddings?\" course and a frequent speaker at events like PyCon Israel and OpenSearchCon.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m not debugging an LLM pipeline or researching multimodal embeddings, I’m designing interiors, listening to ABBA, or negotiating with my three \"opinionated\" cats: Pita, Chooka, and Chonky.</p>\n<br/><p>\n    <b>Available for GenAI consulting, partnerships, public speaking, and private workshops.</b></p>","author":null,"github":"https://github.com/lizozom","stackoverflow":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372086/lizozom","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizak/","siteUrl":"https://lizakatz.dev"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"21a84be3-f8ac-5b20-8971-429ef64ac0b5","excerpt":"I’m excited to announce my new workshop: Introduction to RAG in Production - a comprehensive hands-on session designed for teams looking to implement robust RAG…","html":"<p>I’m excited to announce my new workshop: <strong>Introduction to RAG in Production</strong> - a comprehensive hands-on session designed for teams looking to implement robust RAG systems in real-world environments.</p>\n<h2>What You’ll Learn</h2>\n<h3>Foundation &#x26; Architecture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Introduction to GenAI and LLMs</strong> - Understanding the landscape and capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>LLM Application Architectures</strong> - Design patterns for scalable systems</li>\n<li><strong>Embeddings Overview</strong> - What are embeddings and how they power semantic search</li>\n<li><strong>Vector Database Comparison</strong> - Choosing the right storage solution</li>\n<li><strong>Data Exploration Fundamentals</strong> - Analyzing and understanding your data for RAG</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Production RAG Pipeline</h3>\n<p>We’ll build a complete RAG system covering every critical step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Document Preprocessing</strong> - Text extraction, chunking strategies, and optimization</li>\n<li><strong>Data Ingestion</strong> - Efficient embedding generation and storage</li>\n<li><strong>Querying &#x26; Search</strong> - Semantic retrieval and relevance scoring</li>\n<li><strong>Document Post-processing</strong> - Context ranking and filtering</li>\n<li><strong>Answer Generation</strong> - Prompt engineering and response optimization</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluation</strong> - Metrics, testing frameworks, and quality assurance</li>\n<li><strong>Production Challenges</strong> - Scaling, monitoring, and maintenance</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Who Should Attend</h2>\n<p>This workshop is ideal for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineering teams implementing RAG systems</li>\n<li>Data scientists exploring production deployment</li>\n<li>Product managers overseeing AI initiatives</li>\n<li>CTOs evaluating RAG solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Format</h2>\n<p>Interactive 3-hour workshop combining theory with practical implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in bringing this workshop to your team?</strong> <a href=\"mailto:your-email\">Contact me</a> to discuss custom sessions tailored to your specific use cases and tech stack.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Available for both in-person and remote delivery.</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/rag-production-workshop/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Workshop: Introduction to RAG in Production","date":"July 16, 2025","dateRaw":"2025-07-16","description":"Learn to build and deploy production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with hands-on guidance from preprocessing to evaluation.","author":"Liza Katz"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/rag-production-workshop/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/top-voice-search-recognition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Recognized as a Top Voice in Search Tech by Pulse Support"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/rag-opensearch-webinar-announcement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Upcoming Webinar: RAG with OpenSearch - A Crash Course for Building RAG Applications"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877819913"],"slicesMap":{}}
